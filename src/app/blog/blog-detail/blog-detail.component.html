      <div class="card-title">Jerk Roasted Kuri Squash with Bulgur Salad</div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>One of my favorite ways to serve squash is a dish that showcases the beauty of the squash.
          Usually this means the squash is left in a semi-whole state and stuffed.
          These roasted kuri wedges have a bold flavor matched with an easy bulgur salad topping.
          Perfect for the holidays or as a dinner for impressing your friends.
          <br />
          These jerk roasted kuri squash quarters are a bit of a mix between a traditional jerk marinade and the jerk seasoning.
          The marinade typically uses all whole and fresh ingredients (even down to fresh allspice berries if available).
          However, for ease of the recipe, I used Frontier Co-op’s ground allspice along with a bit of cinnamon to add warmth.
          Traditional jerk marinade also uses scotch bonnet peppers but I cook for crowds that need a bit lower heat level.

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <h3>Squash</h3>
        <p>
        <br /><br />
        1 red kuri squash<br />
        2 tablespoons minced scallion<br />
        1 tablespoon minced fresno or red jalapeño pepper<br />
        1 small garlic clove, minced<br />
        1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme<br />
        1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger<br />
        1 teaspoon soy sauce<br />
        1 teaspoon ground Frontier Co-op Allspice<br />
        1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br />
        2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil<br />
        Topping<br />
        <br /><br />
        2 cups packed arugula<br />
        1/2 cup cooked bulgur<br />
        1/4 cup pomegranate seeds<br />
        3 tablespoons lemon vinaigrette<br />
        <br /><br />
        </p>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <p>
        <br /><br />
        Preheat your oven to 400˚F. Quarter the squash and remove the seeds. Place cut-side up in a roasting pan.
        In a small bowl combine the scallions with the fresno pepper, garlic, thyme, ginger, soy sauce, allspice, and cinnamon.
        Stir, adding enough olive oil to form a thick paste. Spoon the paste over the squash, spreading across all the flesh of the squash.
        Roast until the squash is tender, 35 to 45 minutes.
        While the squash is roasting, combine the arugula with the bulgur and pomegranate seeds.
        Add in the vinaigrette and toss until combined.
        Once the squash is done, divide the arugula onto the roasted squash.
